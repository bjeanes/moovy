A simple ruby library to scrape IMDB

USAGE:

require 'Imdb'

movie = Imdb.find_movie_by_id('tt0382932')
# or
movie = Imdb.find_movie_by_name('Ratatouille')

puts "IMDB ID: #{movie.imdb_id}"
puts "Title: #{movie.title}"
puts "Plot: #{movie.plot}"
puts "Runtime: #{movie.runtime}"
puts "Rating: #{movie.rating}"
puts "Poster URL: #{movie.poster_url}"

Thats about all it does. its simple. I only made it to work with another project.
